# laravelFirstSite
## A programming-exercise

>1. Setup Laravel to work with Docker so the site can be published locally using its containers.
>2. A simple Login-System using Laravel Sanctum shall be implemented.
>3. Also, two Dummy-Users should be seeded in the database.
>4. After the login, implement a CSV-Upload to write its data to a seperate database table (Company-Name, First-Name, Last-Name, E-Mail, Phone-Number).

Notes:
I will be using the same MySQL container if that works and will try to stick to the MVC pattern.
